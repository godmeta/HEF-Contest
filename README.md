# HEF-Contest

The Hilbert-Euler-Fibonacci Metaprogramming Contest (HEF-MPC) is a 45 year late response to Hofstadter's "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach"
published in 1979. 

HEF-MPC is based on an "upgrade" of metaphors or paradoxes of the giant trio of mathematics, namely 
Hilbert Hotel, Euler's Seven Bridges of Konigsberg and Fibonacci series:

- A. Euler's Konigsberg is now a "business park" in DMeta Decentralised Metaverse.
- B. Hilbert Hotel is located within Euler Business Park, with room number assigned using hash numbers.
- C. Fibonacci University, also located in Euler Business Park, conducts flipped classroom teaching by requiring students to submit assignments in the form of social media videos weekly or monthly, thereby recruiting new students in consistent with Fibonacci series.
