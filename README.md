# Hilbert-Euler-Fibonacci Metaprogramming Contest 

The Hilbert-Euler-Fibonacci Metaprogramming Contest (HEF-MPC) is a 45 year late response to Hofstadter's "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach" (GEB)
published in 1979. 

HEF-MPC is based on an "upgrade" of metaphors or paradoxes of the giant trio of mathematics, namely 
Hilbert Hotel, Euler's Seven Bridges of Konigsberg and Fibonacci series:

- A. Euler's Konigsberg is now a "business park" in DMeta Decentralised Metaverse.
- B. Hilbert Hotel is located within Euler Business Park, with room number assigned using hash numbers.
- C. Fibonacci University, also located in Euler Business Park, conducts flipped classroom teaching by requiring students to submit assignments in the form of social media videos weekly or monthly, thereby recruiting new students in consistent with Fibonacci series.

HEF model attempts to answer (some of) the questions mentioned in GEB using metaprogramming, a term intended to describe abstraction of programming algorithms independent of programming languages.

HEF is one step ahead of Feynman's technique in the sense that problems and solutions shall be stated in metaprogramming scripts, in FORTH programming language or equivalent.

Why should anyone (Tom, Dick or Harry? Julia, Maria or Fatimah, to be politically correct) care about HEF?

In DMeta Decentralised Metaverse, everyone can own a piece of the Metaverse, and therefore IN REAL LIFE, gains REAL profits from the operations and transactions of DMeta Decentralised Metaverse.

IN REAL LIFE, the top 5 tech giants, collectively also known as MAGA (Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Google, Apple) achieved total revenues exceeding USD 1.2 trillion in 2022. (2023 figures to be avialable soon.)

The Hash Number as the room number in Hilbert Hotel, holds the secret for users and free software programmers to claim royalties from social media giants for using their data and source code, where a mere 0.1% of only 5 tech companies amount to more than USD 1 billion per year!!
