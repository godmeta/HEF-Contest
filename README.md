# HEF-Contest

The Hilbert-Euler-Fibonacci Metaprogramming Contest (HEF-MPC) is a 45 year late response to Hofstadter's "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach"
published in 1979. 

HEF-MPC is based on an "upgrade" of metaphors or paradoxes of the giant trio of mathematics, namely 
Hilbert Hotel, Euler's Seven Bridges of Konigsberg and Fibonacci series:

A. Euler's Konigsberg is now a "business park" in DMeta Decentralised Metaverse.
